# Column selection

Column selection allows users to select one or more columns in a table. This can be useful for various purposes, such as highlighting important data or enabling actions on selected columns.

## Enabling column selection

To enable column selection, you need to set the `columnSelectionMode` prop on the `Table` component. This prop can take two values: `single` or `multiple`.
Then you can push your controlled state into it. To make it easier to use with typescript both states can be pushed but only one will be used:

<Controls of={DataStories.ColumnSelection} />
<Canvas of={DataStories.ColumnSelection} />

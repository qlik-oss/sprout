# Getting Started

Welcome to the Sprout CSS Table documentation.
Once your React app is ready, you can add the following dependencies:

## Installation

Install the package using your preferred package manager. For example, if you are using `pnpm`, run:

```bash
pnpm i @qlik/sprout-css-table
```

## Importing Components

You can import the components in any `tsx` file like this:

```tsx
import { Table } from "@qlik/sprout-css-table";
```

## Define rows

Each row in DataTable and ListTable is an object with key-value pairs that correspond to the column and its value.
In ListTable and DataTable we named it as `rows`.

```tsx
type MyObject = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
};

const rows: MyObject[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "Qlik Cloud Analytics", description: "Uncover insights" },
  { id: 2, name: "Qlik Talend Cloud", description: "Deliver trusted data" },
  { id: 3, name: "Talend Data Fabric", description: "Unify, integrate and govern disparate data environments" },
  { id: 4, name: "Qlik Sense (on-prem)", description: "Seamless integration of data from multiple systems" },
  { id: 5, name: "Qlik Replicate", description: "Accelerate data ingestion and streaming" },
  { id: 6, name: "Qlik Answers", description: "Gen-AI driven answers from unstructured content" },
];
```

## Define columns

```tsx
import { type ColumnDef } from "@qlik/sprout-css-table";

const columns: ColumnDef<MyObject>[] = [
  { field: "name", headerName: "Product Name", width: 200 },
  { field: "description", headerName: "Description", width: 300 },
];
```

## Table

Warning: This component is in it's early stage, you should not use without working closely with the design system team.

Used to display structured data in a tabular format, with rows and columns. It organizes and presents information for easy scanning, comparison, and interaction.

HTML markup use `div` and not `table` here is why:

- Performance
  - `table` takes more time to render.
  - `div` based grids can be virtualized.

- Flexibility:
  - `table` elements come with rigid rules
    - columns cannot easily have independent widths
    - pinned columns, column resizing are hard to implement
  - `div` elements can be styled and positioned easily

- Responsive:
  - `table` elements are not responsive by nature
  - `div` elements can be made responsive by using flexbox or grid layout

- Accessibility:
  - `table` elements are semantically correct
  - `div` elements can be made accessible by using ARIA roles

<Canvas of={TableStories.HTMLTable} sourceState="shown" />

Looking for a library we have the following you should compare using [npmtrends](https://npmtrends.com/@mui/x-data-grid-vs-@tanstack/react-virtual-vs-ag-grid-react-vs-react-virtualized)

## TanStack Table

[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/) is a headless library for building powerful talbes & datagrids.
It gives all the features we need without providing any UI which is perfect to build a Design System.

You can find our integration of TanStack [qlik-trial/sprout-css-table](https://github.com/qlik-trial/sprout-css-table)

## AgGrid

[ag-grid-react](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/getting-started/) is a well know table/grid on the market.
It provides a lot of features and is very customizable but it is based on customization which doesn't fit well design system.

We have a WIP theme but not used and not working enough well to be exposed.

## MUI X Data Grid

[@mui/x-data-grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) is a fast and extendable React data table and React data grid. It's a feature-rich component available with MIT or commercial licenses.

No work has been done to integrate it with our design system for now.

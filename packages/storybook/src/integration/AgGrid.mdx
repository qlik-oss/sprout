[AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) is the best grid in the world. It provides a strong set of features and it is themeable.

It is a great library to use in your application. Though the theme is a based on customization so we do not have a full control.
We have started our sprout 2 grid history with it but no more effort has been pushed into it.

So you will find here a demo of the current integration with Sprout.

# Getting Started

Welcome to the Sprout CSS Hooks documentation! This guide will help you get started with using the Sprout CSS Hooks library in your React projects.

## Installation

To install the Sprout CSS Hooks library, you can use npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @qlik/sprout-hooks
```

## Usage

This package is used by all the react components built in Sprout. It follows semver. The primary target is to share useful internal hooks that we need across multiple repositories.

## Available Hooks

- [useContainer](/docs/usecontainer--docs): A hook to track the width of a container element.
- [useId](/docs/useid--docs): A hook to create id from an optional id.
- [useMedia](/docs/usemedia--docs): A hook to respond to CSS media query changes in React components.

# Tooltip

Tooltips are contextual helpers that show information about an element when being hovered or focused.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from "@qlik/sprout-css-react";


<Tooltip title="Tooltip content">
  <button>Hover or focus me</button
</Tooltip>
```

> Note: For performance reason we do not mount the content of the tooltip except if it has an explicit `id`.
> That is due to accessiblity requirement, if there is an id, an other element may refer to it using `aria-labelledby`.

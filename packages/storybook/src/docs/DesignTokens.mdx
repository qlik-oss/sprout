# Design Tokens

In [Sprout](https://internal.qlik.dev/design/sprout/), we use [design tokens](https://internal.qlik.dev/design/sprout/design-tokens/).

We implement tokens using [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). You can also read the article on [Using CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for more details.

## Source

The tokens are managed outside of this repository in the package `@qlik/design-tokens`.

## IDE Extensions / Developer Experience

If you are using VSCode, we recommend trying the [CSS Variable Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vunguyentuan.vscode-css-variables) extension. It provides autocompletion for CSS variables, making it easier to work with design tokens.

## How to Use

If you’ve followed the steps in the Getting Started guide, you’ve already used the `ThemeProvider`. This means you can now reference tokens directly using native CSS syntax like this:

```css
.foo {
  color: var(--sprout-common-foreground-color-default);
  padding: var(--sprout-common-spacing-s);
  width: var(--sprout-common-sizing-3xl);
}
```

The philosophy behind tokens is to avoid relying on specific values and instead trust the semantic meaning of the tokens. As a frontend developer, your code should work seamlessly with different values, even if you don’t control them.

This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t test these values. Storybook provides an excellent way to test the changes supported by Sprout.

You can also use our [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classNames, which are implemented using [sprout-css-modules](?path=/docs/css-sprout-css-modules--docs). All class names follow the Tailwind CSS naming convention. Here’s an example:

```jsx
import { classNames } from "@qlik/sprout-css-react";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className={classNames("flex", "bg_default", "text_default")}>
      Hello world
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Tokens Customization

By customizing token values, you can make significant changes to the design. Our tokens are organized into different dimensions:

- **Appearance**: Covers all colors and is the first step in customization.
- **Roundness**: Helps adjust the UI to be more rounded or sharper.
- **Typography**: Allows you to specify where your fonts are located.
- **Density**: Focuses on accessibility and should generally not be changed.

These tokens are considered a public API, enabling integrations to provide new values and make the UI look different.

We will provide multiple examples in the future to help developers test their UI with "extreme" configurations.

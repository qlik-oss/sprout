# Progress

Progress indicators, or loaders, are used to show progression of system events. They can be determinate or indeterminate.

## ProgressBar

Used for progress representation. ProgressBar directly inherits properties from [HTML div element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) but add some extra properties to handle the progress representation.

### Usage

```tsx
import { ProgressBar } from "@qlik/sprout-react";

<ProgressBar percent="70" aria-label="work in progress" />;
```

### Properties

<Canvas of={Progress.PlaygroundProgressBar} />
<Controls of={Progress.PlaygroundProgressBar} />

### Accessibility

[MDN ARIA: progressbar role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/progressbar_role)

HTML Structure

- `ProgressBar` uses the HTML tag `div`
- if the props `percent` is set
  - the role `progressbar` is used.
  - the attributes `aria-value[min|max|now]` are added
- if no `percent` props is passed it is considered as indetermined
  - the role `status` is used.
  - the attributes `aria-busy` are added

## ProgressCircular

Used for progress representation within components, such as a button or a textfield. Can be used by its own. ProgressCircular directly inherits properties from [SVG element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg) but add some extra properties to handle the progress representation.

### Usage

```tsx
import { ProgressCircular } from "@qlik/sprout-react";

<ProgressCircular size="m" percent="70" />;
```

### Properties

<Canvas of={Progress.PlaygroundProgressCircular} />
<Controls of={Progress.PlaygroundProgressCircular} />

### Accessibility

This component is a visual component made using SVG. It rely on the following aria-attributes to describe the progress semantic:

- if no `percent` props: it uses [role="status"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/status_role)
- if `percent` props: it uses [role="progressbar"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/progressbar_role)

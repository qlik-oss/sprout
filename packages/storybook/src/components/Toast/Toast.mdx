# Toast

A Toast is a small, non-intrusive message that pops up temporarily to notify users about an action or event.
It typically appears at the edge of the screen and disappears automatically after a few seconds, though it can be dismissed manually.
Toasts are ideal for brief, context-aware feedback like form submissions, errors, or connection status updates.
They should be used to provide real-time alerts without interrupting the user’s workflow.

```tsx
import { Toast, type ToastProps } from "@qlik/sprout-react";

<Toast.Container placement="top">
  <Toast.Content
    severity="info"
    title="Document created"
    message="You will find it here"
    onClose={() => {}}
    action={{ label: "Undo", onClick: () => {} }}
  />
</Toast.Container>;
```

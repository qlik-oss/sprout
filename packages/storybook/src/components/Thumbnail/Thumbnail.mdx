# Thumbnail

Thumbnails represent an artifact in the system. There are two types, `type="img"` which expects an html image element as child, and `type="icon"` which expects an svg icon.

```tsx
import { Thumbnail } from "@qlik/sprout-react";
import PersonIcon from "@qlik/sprout-icons/react/Person";

<Thumbnail size="xl" type="icon">
    <PersonIcon />
</Thumbnail>

<Thumbnail size="xl" type="img">
    <img src={src} alt="avatar" />
</Thumbnail>
```

# Breadcrumb

A breadcrumb is a navigational UI for hierarchical content.
The `Breadcrumb` component extends the native [HTML nav element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/nav) attributes, so all standard navigation landmark properties are supported.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, Link } from "@qlik/sprout-css-react";

<Breadcrumb
  items={[
    {
      label: "Root",
      href: "/",
    },
    {
      label: "Folder",
      href: "/folder",
    },
    {
      label: "Page",
      href: "/page",
    },
  ]}
/>

// Both examples are equivalent and valid but note that you need
// to add the `aria-current="page"` attribute on the last link.

<Breadcrumb>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <Link href="/folder">Folder</Link>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <Link href="/folder/mypage" aria-current="page">
        current page
      </Link>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
</Breadcrumb>
```

## Properties

## Accessibility

The `composition` API doesn't add the needed attribute to respect the accessibility spec, so please consider that great powers comes with responsibilities.

[W3/WAI/ARIA/APG Breadcrumb](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/)

The current component use the `Link` component so refer to it for the corresponding accessibility questions.

- The set of Links is structured using an ordered list.
- The Breadcrumb (nav element) is labeled Breadcrumb identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
- The Link to the current page has aria-current set to page. If the element representing the current page is not a link, aria-current is optional.

# Grid

Grid is a powerful layout system available as a React component.
It's entirely built on top `@qlik/sprout-css-modules` [grid](/?path=/docs/css-sprout-css-modules--docs#grid) and [media](/?path=/story/css-sprout-css-modules--media)

Sprout defines a 16 based column system that is great to create responsive layouts.

## Grid.Container

<Canvas of={GridContainerStories.GridContainer} />

### API

<Controls of={GridContainerStories.GridContainer} />

## Grid.Column

<Canvas of={GridColumnStories.GridColumn} />
<Controls of={GridColumnStories.GridColumn} />

## Responsive styles

The `useMedia` hook is a React hook that allow you to easily get the current viewport size.

```tsx
import { useMedia } from "@qlik/sprout-css-hooks";
```

<Canvas of={GridStories.ResponsiveStyles} />

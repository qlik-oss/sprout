# Tag

Tags are clickable items used for actions. They can have different styles depending on the needs.
To use it you just have to import the Tag component like this:

```tsx
import { Tag, TagButton, TagLink, type TagProps } from "@qlik/sprout-react";

<Tag
  color="info"
  text="Tag"
  size="s"
  onRemove={() => {}}
  badge={{ color: "info", type: "number", text: "14" }}
  icon={<MyIcon />}
/>;
```

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />
<Controls of={Stories.Playground} />

## Variants

`TagLink` and `TagButton` are interactive variant of the `Tag`.
Note `onRemove` and `color` properties are not accepted on these variants.

## Accessibility

- `Tag` is a simple text element so it does not need any special accessibility treatment.
- `TagLink` is a wrapper of `Tag` using the HTML anchor `a` tag. It does not need any special accessibility treatment.
- `TagButton` is a wrapper of `Tag` using the HTML `button` tag. It does not need any special accessibility treatment.
